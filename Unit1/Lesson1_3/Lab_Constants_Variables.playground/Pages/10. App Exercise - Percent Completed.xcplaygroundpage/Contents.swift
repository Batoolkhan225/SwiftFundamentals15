## App Exercise - Percent Completed

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 You decide that your fitness tracking app should show the user what percentage of his/her goal has been achieved so far today. Declare a variable called `percentCompleted` and set it to 0. Do not explicitly assign it a type.
 */

var percentCompleted = 0  // Implicitly inferred as an Int

//:  Imagine that partway through the day a user has taken 3,467 steps out of the 10,000 step goal. This means he/she is 34.67% of the way to his/her goal. Assign 34.67 to `percentCompleted`. Does the code compile? Go back and explicitly assign a type to `percentCompleted` that will allow the code to compile.

percentCompleted = 34.67  // This will not compile because `percentCompleted` is inferred as an Int, and 34.67 is a Double.

// Explicitly assign `percentCompleted` as a Double to make it work.

var percentCompletedExplicitly: Double = 0  // Explicitly declare as a Double
percentCompletedExplicitly = 34.67  // This will now compile
print("Percent Completed: \(percentCompletedExplicitly)%")  // Prints "Percent Completed: 34.67%"
